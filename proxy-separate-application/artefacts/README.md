# Artefacts
This directory is populated with built artefacts. They should not be stored in git, but generated locally, ignored by git and potentially stored on a server (eg as packages on github).

The artefacts nay be based on documentation or code builds. How they are obtained is not described here, but near what they are sourced from, some understanding of how the repository is structured and where these artefacts come from is likely required. They may also be encapsulated in build scripts (eg a makefile)
